## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the steps taken to obtain and analyse data from the [Parliamentary Monitoring Group](https://pmg.org.za/) and the [People's Assembly](https://www.pa.org.za/). 

The objective is to use the data obtained from different pages of the website to create a more accessible format in which citizens can engage with the information. 

## Scraping data for MPs

The [main page](https://pmg.org.za/members/) for getting MP information contains the names, party, and link to a page dedicated toward each MP. Gathering all the information from this page allows traversing the links to each MP's page to get more specific information regarding the committees that the member is or has been a part of, the interests that they have declared and which constitutency office they are affiliated with.
